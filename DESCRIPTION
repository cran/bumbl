Description: Bumblebee colonies grow during worker production, then
    decline after switching to production of reproductive individuals
    (drones and gynes).  This package provides tools for modeling and
    visualizing this pattern by identifying a switchpoint with a growth
    rate before and a decline rate after the switchpoint. The mathematical
    models fit by bumbl are described in Crone and Williams (2016)
